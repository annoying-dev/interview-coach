# interview-coach
info dump to coach peeps on LC hazing IVs &amp; System Design. 
TODO: Meh, maybe private this but there's wealth in knowledge sharing and transparency? 

# My Credentials
- 1,300+ interviews conducted at karat on coding, system design and knowledge questions
- 200+ code review
- Mentored new interviewers at their inital stages to bring consistency to interviewing and do it empathetically
- 10+ interviews in system design at Chime for midlevel to senior roles. Taking the initiative to generate more interviewing content at Chime, until I quit.
- 20-30+ interviews at Intuit on OOD and coding. Also helped give feedback to content team. 
- I doubled my income every year and went from $50k -> $400k (4 yrs) despite being a C- student, almost dropping out, and my support system telling me I wasn't intelligent and that I'll never make it. I may not know what people from coding bootcamps or are self-taught feel like but I my experiences are adjacent. I am a good coach for people who are at a stage in their life where they are willing to make space and time to do whatever training necessary to make a transition that improves their financial wealth. In addition to giving them a new sense of confidence.

# Standard Initial Questions
- What was your past level and experience(s)?
- Which companies are you targeting right now? (FAANG, unicorn pre-ipo, series BLAH, interesting problem/passion)
- What level are you targeting? [entry, mid-level, senior, staff, etc.]
- What is your comfort level with [coding/system design]?

## People are perfectly capable of helping themselves. 
The problem usually breaks down to:
- they don't know where the bar is; how they compare to pool of candidates a particular company has. This will be different at every company.
- they don't realize the emotional drain it will take to do those LC problems and get them to a stable state. Emotional support is so important and undervalued.
- they don't know where to look to get more options. Rejections, zero feedback, fishes that don't hook on demoralize job searches. It's painstakingly time consuming.
- they don't have time or are misinformed about the market. Many stories of no time, wanting stability and hard to filter companies on their own, being grateful to even have a job, etc. 
- some people just want money and if they were just honest with themselves about it, I could make them 2x, 3x their income. Money can't buy happiness but it helps bruh.
