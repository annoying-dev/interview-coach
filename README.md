# Holistic Interview Coaching ‚≠ê
Info dump to coach peeps on LC hazing IVs &amp; System Design. Cause my chaotic methods and seemingly random ramblings will get lost in the wind if I don't have some framework/guide. People tend to refrain of being honest with themselves and others as a form of protection, preservation of identity, or simply because they never had to articulate their unfiltered desires to someone. I need to create a safe space for them to bring their whole selves to the table. Then I can point out the key they had all along to unlock their potential. This is very important. You can give people all the answers in the world and it will fall upon deaf ears.

# Need to Figure This Out Quickly ‚ùó
You have to remember that the way people perceive themselves is often times not an accurate depiction of who they are. People find themselves through art: books, music, movies. That may be one path to getting [the answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XhSMKL8jqI) you're looking for. 
- Intrinsically or Extrinsically motivated?
- What does their home life/responsibilities look like?
- Depth of Knowledge (so many sus projects and skills)
- Learning Style

# Goal ü•Ö
- Build trust in a short amount of time
- Give more than the person is expecting
- Actionable feedback

# Credentials üéñÔ∏è
- [IGotAnOffer Intervieiwing Coach](https://app.igotanoffer.com/coaching/tech/michelle/)
- 1,300+ interviews conducted at karat & fintech on coding, system design and knowledge questions
- 300+ code review & mentoring
- Content developer for LC hazing style questions. sadly.
- $50k -> $450k+ (4 yrs)

# Standard Initial Questions ü§î
- What was your past level and experience(s)?
- Which domain/company did you work at?
- Which companies are you targeting right now? (FAANG, unicorn pre-ipo, series BLAH, interesting problem/passion)
- What level are you targeting? [entry, mid-level, senior, staff, etc.]
- What is your comfort level with [coding/system design]?

# Main Problem Areas üõ†Ô∏è
- The hiring bar (differs by company)
- Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect (Overestimate/Understimate coding and system design skills)
- Applying to jobs is soul sucking and so if failing interviews. Secret sauce is resilience and persistence, baby.
- they don't have time or are misinformed about the market. Many stories of no time, wanting stability and hard to filter companies on their own, being grateful to even have a job, etc. 
- some people just want money and if they were just honest with themselves about it, I could make them 2x, 3x their income. Money can't buy happiness but it helps bruh.

# Observations üëÄ
- There is a stark contrast when coaching women vs men
- People don't have as much time as they think, and they don't realize the time commitment. They need to strategize their job search and learning.
- A person's environment and people they surround themselves with, especially their partner if they have one, have A SHIT TON of influence on how they grow.
- The smartest people I've worked with are nearly impossible to convince to move jobs. Why is that? On an individual level I know why, but can are there any common characteristics?

# TODO
The more specific and concrete you are, the better. None of that frou frou bullshit. Simple words are best; mind the LCD. Don't you dare use buzzwords. MICROSERVICE. üíÄ
- create a rambling folder to store your reflections 
- WIC women engineering folder. Unfiltered. Workplaces say they're inclusive/diverse but it stops at hiring. The environment is still toxic af.
- Break down interview characteristics by financial staging (pre-seed, seed, series A, etc)
- Profile everyone you coached (What did they want? Who were they? Why did they want that? What was their limiting belief? Their North Star?)
- create a loose guide on what measured progress in coding looks like
- create a loose guide on what measured progress in system design looks like
- create inventory of helpful links to system design and coding patterns. standard.
- Take Home Tests, LC Interview, OOD, OA, Trivia Bullshit, Brain Teaser fuckery
- Check back in with Aline as interviewing io expands

# Books üìö
- Influence by Robert Cialdini
- Non Violent Communication by Marshall B Rosenberg
- The Defining Decade by Meg Jay
- The Art of War Sun Tzu
- Pragmatism by William James (Double check this is the right book. Pragmatism back then carried a different meaning than how it is used today)

# Other materials üìù
- Carl Jung & The Psychology of Self-Sabotage
- There was a book on shadow people and how to identify them in life. Look in YT history
- Life Coach (ICF) ~5k, ADHD Coach? 
- Humor/Comedy books or classes. Cause people will shoot you if you straight up tell them like it is
